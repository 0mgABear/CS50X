Online version of CS50 : Introduction to Computer Science

## Week 0: Scratch , Computational Thinking

- solving problems more methodically and translating into code.
- Scratch from MIT.
- week 1: on C. Lower level language.
- Take a look at memory and bugs in future lessons.
- Transition into algorithms : step by step instruction to solve some problems.
- Introduces to C first then to Python (higher-level language).

### Computer Science

- programming is a big part
- unary : fancy way of saying digits / numbers
  - base-1
- computers are binary (implying 2).
- binary digit is the origin of the word bit. Bit is just 0 and 1.
  - How do they speak or solve problems in binary?
  - Need to do so physically somehow.
  - Think lightbulb: If you want to represent a 0, you just keep that switch off. On the contary, 1 is just turning the lightbulb on.
  - Million to billions of switches : transistors. Electricity is there, or it's not.
- base-2 (a.k.a binary), comes with certain rules.
- byte : 8 bits. Octet equivablent.
- A usually represented by the number 65. ASCII.
  - mapping between numbers and letters.
  - Unicode. (includes other languages)
  - 32 bits : 4B permutations, more than we ever need!
  - Even emojis are just unicode.
- Abstraction : simplification of something. Focus on the high level goals, and not so much the low level stuff.
- Verbs --> functions.

## Week 1 : C

- source code : human written code
- machine code : what computers understand and execute.
- compiler: convert source to machine code.
  - make (C) : it's essentially the compiler.
  - \n : escape sequence, move the cursor to the next line.
  - ? #include <stdio.h> : needed, but why?
    - you don't get printf automatically in c
    - header file to declare that the function exists.
    - only include the functions you care about.
    - stands for: standard input/output.
  - %s : placeholder, format code. Placeholder for a string.
  - %i : Placeholder for integer.
  - %li : Placeholder for long integer.
  - %f : Placeholder for floating point value.
    - %% : use 2 if you want to use % for whatever reason. Treated specially inside C.
    - %.20f : 20 decimal places.
- Training library: cs50.h
- If you want to get back a return vale, need to declare a variable.
  - = : assignment, not equality.
  - == : comparison
  - free choice of variable name.
  - C is more pedantic , need to tell C the TYPE of value.
    - Statically typed language!
- make (filename), followed by ./ to execute the file.
- Best practice: opening curly brace keep it on a separate line, don't follow Javascript syntax.
  - use " " (double quotes) for any string > 1 character.
  - use ' ' (single quotes) for deliberately single characters (chars)
  - || (2 vertical bars) for OR operator.
- Count from 0, count up.
- While loops and for(int) loops as well.
- Const : immutable.
- Do while loop!

  - Also exists in [Javascript] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/do...while)

- Linux: known for CLI env.

- Void within function : does not take any arguments.
- Declare what type of output at the very front. (int/bool/e.t.c.)

- 32bit: max number ~ 4B.
  - but highest it can count is ~2B (allocate half to negative numbers).
  - integer overflow : run out of bits.
- long : long integers.
- truncation could be a problem --> type casting.
- floating-point imprecision : limit on how precise numbers can be.
- double : uses twice the number of bits. (64)

## Week 2 : Arrays

- ciphertext
  - result of encrypting some piece of information
- encryption / art of cryptogaphy

Some recap:

- compile : source -> machine code
- clang compiler, underneath the hood
  - easier to use "make"
  - tedious to use : clang -o hello hello.c -lcs50
  - no real benefit of using clang manually
- another: gcc
- command line arguments:
  - (word/phrase) keywords that modify the behaviour of that command
  - a.out : assembler output (default when compiling with clang)
- whole process: preprocessing -> compiling -> assembling -> linking
  - preprocessing: # (preprocessor directive), special symbol in C.
  - compiling : change to assembly code --> closer to what computers themselves undertand
  - assembling : converts to actual machine code
  - linking : link with preprocessed code (link all the binary)
- can use printf() as a form of debugging.
