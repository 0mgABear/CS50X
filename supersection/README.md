## Week 1 Super Section

Q : Why does C care so much about data types?

- specificity
- tells the compiler how much memory to reserve.
- let C know what we are talking about
  - e.g. 65 can be a number or also represent A (ASCII)

Q: why do we only declare the type of variable only once and not in subsequent lines of code?

- computer already knows what type it is and should be, no need to tell it again.

Format Codes

- Number:
  - int (%i)
  - long (%li)
  - float (%f)
  - double (%f)
- Text:
  - char (%c)
  - string(%s)
